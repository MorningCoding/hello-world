# hello-world

Hi there, Pirashanth here. Neuroscience undergrad and biomedical engineering masters. Are my degrees what define me? I hope not! 
I like building apps for educational purposes. I think gamification of education can move mountains when it comes to keeping children motivated and engaged.

Also, it's useful for data analysis too I guess :P

Goodbye for now :)
